We created FitYourGenes to utilize Illumina’s genomic data to improve everyone’s QoL, as well as capitalize on an industry that will undoubtedly continue to grow in the forseeable future. FitYourGenes utilizes genomic data to determine which diseases users are susceptible to, what nutritional deficiencies users have, and the body type of each user. It then returns this information, and personalizes foods, nutrients, and excercises suggested for each individual.

On the front-end we used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and libraries such as Bootstrap. On the back end, we implemented the Genome Link API and Flask for the web server and to render the HTML.
